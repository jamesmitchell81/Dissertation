It is a preference that the requirement for user interaction be kept to a minimum during the image processing phases as the desire that the final application be accessible to a wide range of user ability.

The addition of cropping functionality will:
1. Reduce the size of the representation requiring processing, therefore improving performance.
2. Reduce the variety of data that is required to be processed ensuring only relevant detail is analysed.
3. Allow the user to specify the exact regions of text for analysis.

A major trade off of adding the crop functionality is a lesser requirement for user interaction upon aspects of the image processing phase that could be considered advanced ability or knowledge requirement.

As an example, the following representation provided by the user contains: two varying regions of handwritten text a) and b), a region of texture resulting from the wooden table in the background c).

![]()

Using the thresholding of the image as an example, the wide range of grey level values of the representation creates difficultly when trying to determine an optimal threshold value that will maintain a strong representation of the required data (the handwritten element of the supplied image) and remove unwanted data. This could potentially require the user to specify the threshold value.

As cropping functionality is common in popular applications such as: Microsoft Word or PowerPoint, and Photoshop, cropping of images likely already within a users knowledge, whereas thresholding functions would not be common an potentially difficult for the user to understand. In addition, a cropping function provides the further benefit by allowing the user more control over the selection of text in images where variance in handwriting style is apparent as in fig...
