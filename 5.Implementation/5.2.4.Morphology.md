#### 5.2.4.6 Thinning.

##### Purpose.

Thinning of the representation will provide data for both the construction of the letterform template, and the recognition of letter slant, cursive connections, and counter shape, patterns.

##### Background.

Thinning is the iterative erosion of a connected set down to a single pixel thickness without splitting the structure. (Burger and Burge, 2014)

Application of a thinning algorithm over a provided image will therefore preserve the required strucuture of the letterform representation, while removing features that are not required, such as contrast. In addition reducing the amount of data required to be processed.

Prior to thinning the representation will need to be thresholded to replecate a binary image.

(Lam, Lee, and Suen, 1992) provides explanation of two varying types of thinning algorithms, seqential and parallel.

> In a sequential algorithm, the pixels are examined for deletion in a fixed sequence in each iteration, and the deletion of *p* in the *nth* iteration depends on all the operations that have been performed so far.

Implementation of a sequential algorithm requires recording of each preceding operation, marking pixels for deletion on a given condition. At the end of an iteration marked pixels are scrutinized futher before removal.
(Lam, Lee, and Suen, 1992)

> In a parallel algorithm, the deletion of pixels in the *nth* would only depend on the result that remains after the (*n* - 1)th; thefefore, all pixels can be examined independently in a parallel manner each iteration.  

Parallel thinning algorithms pixels are removed during each iteration and therefore only act upon the image data left by the last iteration.

Due to performance concerns with the requirement to maintain reference to pixels marked or "flagged" for deletion in the implementation of a sequential thinning algorithm, a parallel thinning approuched will be used in the initial implementation of this project. 

The Zhang Suen thinning algorithm has been examined due to favorable processing speed, simplicity of computations required, and high level of documentation.

##### 5.2.4.6.1 Zhang Suen Thinning algorithm.

The goal of the Zhang Suen algorithm is to remove all contour points and preserve the structure of the pattern. The deletion of each pixel depends on it self and that of its 8 adjecent / connected neighbours and is split into two subiterations in order to maintain structure.

Zhang Suen define the following conditions for each iteration.

a) ${ 2 } \le B({ P }_{ 1 }) \le { 6 }$

The sum of the 8 (nonzero/black) neighbours of ${P}_{1}$ which are structure pixels is greater then or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 6.  

b) $A({P}_{1}) = 1$

Of the ordered set ${P}_{2}$, ${P}_{3}$, ${P}_{4}$ ... ${P}_{8}$, the sum of each 0 to 1 patterns found equals 1. Therefore in the pattern from ${P}_{2}$ to ${P}_{8}$ (0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1) there are three 01 patterns and so ${P}_{1}$ would not be removed.

c) ${P}_{2} \times {P}_{4} \times {P}_{6} = 0$
d) ${P}_{4} \times {P}_{6} \times {P}_{8} = 0$

Or, one of ${P}_{2}$, ${P}_{4}$, or ${P}_{6}$ is equal to 0 (white) and one of ${P}_{4}$, ${P}_{6}$, or ${P}_{8}$ is equal to 0 (white).  

Where all of these conditions are true, the pixel at the centre of the neighbourhood ${P}_{1}$ is removed, or in the case of this application set to white.

Steps a) and b) are repeated in the second iteration, however c) and d) are changed:

c) ${P}_{2} \times {P}_{4} \times {P}_{8} = 0$
d) ${P}_{2} \times {P}_{6} \times {P}_{8} = 0$

(Zhang and Suen, 1984)

The followning pesudo code has been developed from (Zhang and Suen, 1984) algorithm detailed.

    TODO: IMPLEMENTATION APPENDIX REFERENCE
</div>

Implementation and testing of the Zhang Suen thinning algorithm detailed in their paper (Zhang and Suen, 1984) shows that stems or thin structrues of letterforms are removed completly with vital data is lost.

![Thinning input](../-img/5.2.4.thinning-input-failure.png)

As shown below the stem of b, d h, i, j in this small sample has been removed.

![Thinning output](../-img/5.2.4.thinning-failure.png)

The inaccuracies in (Zhang and Suen, 1984) have be detailed in (Chen and Hsu, 1988) showing that condition a) does not preserve all end points of structures. As discussed by Chen, and Hsu altering condition a) to  ${ 2 } \le B({ P }_{ 1 }) \le { 6 }$ resolves this problem.

![Thinning output with new condition](../-img/5.2.4.thinning-resolution.png)

However, this change will effect different representations in varying ways. Whereas with the thinned typeface detailed above and the structure degraded, applying the original a) condition to a handwritten letterform and the same degradation is not observerd.

Application with the amended condition on the same image shows a high level of trailing artifacts.
