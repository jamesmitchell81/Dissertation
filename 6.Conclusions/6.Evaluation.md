## 6. Project Evaluation.

The implemented features have been evaluated, determining their success as an implementation and as part of this project. Following feature evaluation, the project is evaluated from a software engineering perceptive.

### 6.1 Feature Evaluation.

#### 6.1.1 Cropping Images.

The cropping of images in order to remove non-text elements or textual elements that where unwanted has been successful. Although, in later versions if this application it is possible that non textual areas, such as the background table (Figure: ), could possibly be removed programmatically, allowing the user to specify areas of text to analysis would remain. In addition, the cropping functionality implementation allowed for progress in other areas of the project that would otherwise have been held up by evaluating the removal of non text area.

#### 6.1.2 Noise Removal Features and thresholding.

Although the implementation of spatial filter for the purpose of noise removal has been reasonably successful, due to that subject matter of handwritten text being dark colours on light backgrounds, the removal of noise is a minor issue when a subject will be thresholded. 

![Figure: (l-r) Subject Image, Averaging, Median, Min, Max filters ](../-img/6.1.smoothed-subjects.png)

With each of the examples of subject and the filters implemented (Figure .) and then thresholded to the same value (Figure: ) from this limited set it is possible to see that output presenting the fewest artifact is the thresholded subject image, followed by the median filter (with the median filter showing artifact elsewhere [5.2.3.1.3]).

![Figure: (l-r) Subject Image, Averaging, Median, Min, Max filters thresholded ](../-img/6.1.smooth-comp.png)

Therefore, it may have been possible to forgo the the implementation of filters. 

#### 6.1.3 Morphology.

As with the [6.1.2], the implementation of morphological operations has been successful, applying the operations to the subject image has shown minimal benefit over thresholding for creating a cleaner representation to work with. 

![Figure: (l-r) Subject Image, Erosion, Dilation, Opening, Closing ](../-img/6.1.morph-comp.png)

However, taking a broken subject (Figure ) and applying a dilation operation, broken lines are connected, and missing data in the object is filled

##### 6.1.3.1 Thinning.

The requirement for thinning of the subject came from the desire to created a skeleton letterform template programmatically in addition would possibly have allowed for the analysis of curves and connections in the subject letter forms.

The results of applying the ZhangSuen algorithm to the subject where not as successful as initial hoped (Figure: ) presenting both "Parasitic elements" and line distortion around the high contrast strokes of the subject.

The "Parasitic elements" presented  could be remedied through the implementation of "Pruning" operations (Gonzalez and Woods, 2002, p.545), however, the distorted lines/shapes such as the entry to the "o" character and the join at the entry of the "h" would need to be straightened to present a more ideal representation of the subject.

#### 6.1.4 Letterform Composition.

Two possible methods of creating a letterform template on which extracted attributes would be applied:

1. Programmatically extract forms from an available typeface.
2. Create the template by attaining point information from PaintCode.app (PixelCut, 2016) 

PaintCode.app will take an SVG sample and generate the points presented in Objective-c code (Figure: )

Despite access to this application, the decision was made to apply method 1 and create the template by implementing a tracing algorithm in order to extract the paths of a bitmap representation of a typeface.

    [fillColor setFill];
    [hPath fill];

##### 6.1.4.1 Contour tracing.

The use of a contour tracing algorithm [5.3.1.1] presented three issues in the creation of the template.

1. Inner shapes of character would be ignored.
2. Incorrect assumptions where made about the structure of a thinned representation [5.3.1.1].
3. Assigning control points at which attributes, extracted during analysis, would be applied to the template. 

Despite these issues, the implementation of the Moore Neighbor algorithm was successful. Therefore, this was a specification failure due to not correctly understanding or evaluating the problem, rather then application of the algorithm.

#### 6.1.5 Image Analysis.

Due to time constraints and the lack of a letterform template, only minimal analysis has been achieved.

##### 6.1.5.1 Projection Profile.

Projection profile provides a simple method of extracting four key letterform attributes: Cap-height, x-height, ascender height, descender length. However, the effectiveness of this method is yet to be fully determined as the results have not yet been analysed.
